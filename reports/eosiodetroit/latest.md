### WAX Labs

**URLs**: https://labs.wax.io, https://github.com/worldwide-asset-exchange/wax-labs-ui 

**List of SCs**: labs.wax

**Update**: 
* It was reported to us that there is exploit within the momentjs (time localization) library. We investigated this issue and determined that the reporting user was looking at WAX Labs 2.0 and not the current 3.0 version.
* The current codebase was transferred to WAX's org/public repository. We're still working on migrating the deployment steps to Github.
* The Telegram notifications have been done but not active because there was an expectation/miscommunication that we would be using API keys that the WAX team managed. We will be scheduling a call with the WAX team in the coming weeks to get this fully active and discuss the optimal Github deployment strategy.
* The deliverable filter issue is still being investigated due to difficulty replicating the issue in local/testnet environments.
